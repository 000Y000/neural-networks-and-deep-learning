# Code samples for "Neural Networks for the Determined"

This repository contains code samples for my (forthcoming) book on
"Neural Networks for the Determined".

As the code is written to accompany the book, I don't intend to add
new features.  However, bug reports are welcome, and you should of
course feel free to fork and modify the code.
